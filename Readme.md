NYC Taxi Data Science Project: Comprehensive ML Benchmarking

This repository presents a complete machine learning project focused on the New York City taxi trip dataset. The project is divided into two distinct machine learning challenges: Regression (predicting trip duration) and Classification (predicting the taxi vendor).

The entire pipeline covers data cleaning, feature engineering, implementation of various classical ML models, and deep learning architectures for benchmarking.

1. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

File: Data_prep.ipynb

This notebook details the crucial first steps of the pipeline:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.

Outlier Removal: Filtering unrealistic data (e.g., zero-distance, extremely long/short duration trips, and geographical outliers).

Feature Engineering: Creating essential features like distance (Distance_KM), temporal features (day_of_week, time_of_day_category), and flags for subsequent modeling.

The resulting cleaned and featurized data is saved to be consumed by the model scripts.

2. Regression Analysis (Predicting Trip Duration)

The goal of this section is to predict the continuous variable trip_duration.

⚙️ Setup and Execution

Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need Python and the following key libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn jupyter


Running the Pipeline

Start with Data Prep: Open and execute all cells in Data_prep.ipynb to ensure the cleaned data file is generated and saved in the expected location.

Run Regression Models: Execute the Python scripts in the regression/ folder:

python regression/linear_regre.py
python regression/all_nn_models.py


Run Classification Models: Open and run the individual Jupyter Notebooks in the classification/ folder to train the respective models, generate visualizations, and update the model_metrics.csv file.
